Controller synthesis for a DC DC boost converter to enforce a reach-and-stay 
specification

0. to run this example, you need to the Cudd libarary installed. Please see the
   manual for installation notes.


1. compile the dcdc.cc file

  a) edit the Makefile and adjust the CUDDPATH to the location where the cudd library is installed.

  b) now you should be able to compile the program simply by

    $ make

2. execute 

  $./dcdc     
  computes the symbolic model and synthesizes the controller; 
4. information on the example is found in
